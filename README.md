#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: DirtyMuddyTimer-Calc-Focus is a Chrome extension designed to help a person organize their tasks with an emphasis on prioritization and focus. With this extension, users can create tasks, assign priority levels, and manage their time effectively through an integrated timer feature. 
#### messages.json: Shows the purpose behind each message and how it contributes to the overall user experience. This allows for further languages could be added.
#### icons: self explanitory but this contains the images when the chrome extension is uploaded to the users computer and utilized when loaded/used.
#### styles: options.css & popup.css: The styles are meant to be simple yet functional. I tried a few variations and may update it to include an option to update the format/toggle based on users who have color limitations. The Segoe UI was useful in having a font that's slightly different but allows ease of heavy use (in my opinion). I couldn't get the different colors that were encoded to show up when going for the low, medium, high so that will need to be a future version.
#### background.js: This file is focused in managing the timer's state across the Chrome extension. This file handles the starting, pausing, and resuming of the timer, as well as sending notifications when the timer ends. This was a tricky one to get working since timing in chrome doesn't like to cooperate. Future updates will include a list of what's being focused on underneath the timer.
#### content.js: This file helps inject into the context of web pages opened in the browser. Its main purpose is to highlight specific keywords that are often associated with the tasks selected. 
#### manifest.js: Functions as the configuration file for the Chrome extension. It provides essential and critical information and sets parameters that determine how the extension behaves within the chrome browser. The main parts are including the icons and how they show/work with the chrome extension.
#### options.html: : Creates the user interface for the settings page of the chrome extension, functioning as a gateway for users to customize their experience. Itâ€™s designed with simplicity and clarity in mind (a few variations were made), offering an intuitive layout where users can easily modify settings like the default timer duration. This file facilitates user engagement by allowing adjustments between 1 to 120 minutes, catering to diverse time management needs. The settings page is not only functional but also anticipatory, with placeholders ready to accommodate future features and enhancements. This proactive design approach indicates a commitment to ongoing development and user-centric improvements. The page layout is written to be straightforward yet flexible.
#### options.js: playing a crucial role in handling the saving and loading of user preferences within the extension. This script bridges the user interface with the Chrome extension's storage capabilities, ensuring that user settings are not only saved but also persist across sessions. It encompasses essential functions like capturing user inputs for default timer settings, providing immediate and clear feedback upon saving, and restoring these settings whenever the options page is revisited. This creates a personalized experience for each user, allowing them to tailor the extension's behavior to their individual needs. The script is meticulously designed to offer a smooth, responsive, and error-free interaction, enhancing the overall usability and effectiveness of the extension.
#### popup.html:  is the heart of the extension's user interface. It serves and helps as the primary interaction point for users, allowing them to add tasks, prioritize them, and manage the timer. This file features a clean and intuitive layout where users can easily interact with the core functionalities of the extension. It includes input fields for task creation, a selection dropdown for task prioritization, and dedicated buttons for timer control. The design focuses on user-friendliness, ensuring that all key features are accessible within a few clicks. Additionally, the dynamic update of the tasks list and the real-time timer display contribute to a seamless user experience, keeping users engaged and organized.
#### popup.js: is the main core script that powers the extension's interactive features. This file manages the task list and timer functionalities, providing users with the ability to add, edit, delete, and prioritize tasks, as well as to control the timer directly from the popup interface. Furthermore it manages an array of task objects, allowing for the creation of new tasks with priorities. Other areas included in popup.js: Implements multi-select functionality for tasks using a `Set` to track selected items. Provides UI interaction for adding, editing, and deleting tasks, as well as sorting them by priority. Timer Controls and interfaces with the background script to start, pause, and resume a timer using `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`. By allowing a live update of the timer's status on the popup through `updateTimerDisplay` it helps with the user interface.
